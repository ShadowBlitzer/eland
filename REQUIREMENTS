eLAS is web-based software and requires a functioning PHP webserver to install

IMPORTANT: Starting from 2.6, eLAS has extra dependencies and uses backend components written in python over the AMQ protocol!
IMPORTANT: Starting from 2.7, eLAS will be developed for the PostGres DB backend instead of MySQL

To send emails from 2.6 and up, you will need to install eLAS messenger (emessenger) from http://support.taurix.net/projects/emessenger
To use logging, you will need to set up elaslogger from http://support.taurix.net/projects/elaslogger
